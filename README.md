💡 How It Works
📌 Second-Order Optimization: Uses Hessian diagonal approximation for improved stability.
📌 Dynamic Hessian Updates: Periodically refines curvature estimates for better learning.
📌 Mixed Precision Training: Leverages FP16 & FP32 for faster computations without accuracy loss.
📌 Adaptive Learning Rate: Cosine annealing ensures better long-term optimization.

🔍 Why Use Second-Order Optimization?
Traditional first-order optimizers like SGD and Adam rely only on gradients to update weights, which may lead to slow convergence and inefficient learning. Second-order optimization methods like Sophia utilize Hessian information (curvature of the loss function), allowing:

Faster convergence by adjusting step sizes dynamically.
More stable updates, preventing vanishing/exploding gradients.
Reduced oscillations, leading to better optimization paths.
🔍 Hessian Diagonal Approximation
The Hessian matrix provides insights into how the loss function changes in multiple dimensions. However, computing the full Hessian is computationally expensive. Sophia approximates only the diagonal elements, reducing complexity while maintaining performance benefits.
