#Sophia Optimizer: Enhancing Large Language Model Training
📌 Overview
This project implements and enhances the Sophia Optimizer, a second-order optimization method designed for efficient and scalable training of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-2. By leveraging Hessian diagonal approximation, mixed-precision training, and dynamic learning rate adjustments, Sophia aims to improve convergence speed, stability, and generalization compared to traditional optimizers like Adam and SGD.

🚀 Key Features
✅ Second-Order Optimization: Utilizes Hessian diagonal approximation for efficient curvature-aware updates.
✅ Improved Convergence: Achieves faster and more stable convergence compared to first-order optimizers.
✅ Mixed-Precision Training: Reduces memory usage and computational cost without sacrificing accuracy.
✅ Gradient Clipping & Weight Decay: Enhances stability and prevents gradient explosion.
✅ Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduling: Uses cosine annealing with warm restarts for dynamic learning rates.
✅ Extensive Benchmarking: Performance evaluation on WikiText-103 dataset against Adam and SGD.
